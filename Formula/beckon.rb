  # `serve` (the resident hotkey host) exists only on macOS and Windows; on
  # Linux the compositor owns the keybind, so there is deliberately no service
  # there. `OS.mac?` is evaluated when the formula is loaded, so on Linux no
  # service is registered at all and beckon never appears in
  # `brew services list`.
  #
  # Do NOT nest this in `on_macos do` — `brew style` and `brew audit --strict`
  # both reject that outright ("on_macos cannot include service"), and no
  # formula in homebrew-core does it. Do NOT "simplify" it to `run macos:`
  # either: that leaves `service?` true on Linux, so `brew services start`
  # there fails with "has not implemented #plist, #service or provided a
  # locatable service file" — a broken service instead of no service.
  #
  # `log_path` uses `var`, not `Dir.home`: Homebrew creates a referenced
  # `#{var}/log` directory at install time and gives a home-relative path no
  # such treatment, which would leave launchd failing to open it in silence.

    <<~EOS
      Resident hotkey mode reads a shortcuts file. Create and validate it
      BEFORE starting the service — keep_alive restarts a serve that cannot
      read its config every ~10 seconds, forever:

        mkdir -p ~/.config/beckon
        printf '"ctrl+super+alt+t" = "kitty"\\n' > ~/.config/beckon/apps.toml
        beckon check ~/.config/beckon/apps.toml
        brew services start beckon

      Do not use `sudo brew services start`: that installs a LaunchDaemon,
      which has no window-server session, so hotkeys register and never fire.

      Focusing other apps needs Accessibility permission:
